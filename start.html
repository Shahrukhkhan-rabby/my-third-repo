    <h1>Divine Favor and Inequality in Provision</h1>
    <div>
        <h3>The difference between people in the matter of Sustenance is the rule given by Allah.</h3>
        <p>And Allāh has favored some of you over others in provision. But those who were favored [i.e., given more] would not hand over their provision to those whom their right hands possess [i.e., slaves] so they would be equal to them therein. Then is it the favor of Allāh they reject?
